title: "Recent Changes in OA Publishing in the German Research Landscape"
description: |
In 2021 we published a study on the uptake of Open Access Publishing in the German research landscape, which was based on data from mid-2019. At the end of 2021 we updated the dataset and performed a statistical analysis of variations of OA shares of the investigated institutions. In this post, we compare both datasets and explore the differences with respect to the OA status of pulications.
