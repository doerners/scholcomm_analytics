title: "Recent Changes in Document type classification in OpenAlex compared to Web of Science and Scopus"
description: In June 2024, we published a preprint on the classification of document types in Openalex and compared it with the scholarly databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In this follow-up study, we want to investigate further developments in OpenAlex and compare the results with the proprietary databases Scopus and WoS.

Over the last months, OpenAlex has revised its classification of document types, making it more independent of Crossref, and also introduces new document types such as [preprints and reviews](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/YujaIIjY02A). In addition, document types are now also adopted from [PubMed](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/eXiWOlBXKC0), which raises the question of how these changes affect the analysis of data from OpenAlex. 

Here, we build on the former results of our preprint [@haupka_2024] from June 2024 and provide an updated insight. Our investigation highlighted differences in the curation strategies by scholarly database operators which complicates the inquiry of accurate bibliometric figures. Similar findings were obtained by @donner_document_2017, @visser_large-scale_2021 and @alperin_analysis_2024 which reported deviations between numbers of publication derived from bibliometric databases when restricting to certain document types.

The correct classification of documents is crucial for bibliometric surveys as the are used for various measurements and reports and also for searches in databases and catalogues. The diverge classification of a publication can lead to imprecise assertions about the scholarly landscape, e.g. if a document is labelled as an article in one database and as a letter in another. As our preprint has shown, there is a relatively large gap between publications in scholarly databases that are labelled as research texts and publications that are associated with editorial texts. As of 2023, 1% of the publications analysed in OpenAlex were labelled as editorial texts, compared to over 10% in the commercial databases (based on publications in journals from 2012 to 2022). A change to the document types contained in OpenAlex could also have an impact on the CWTS Leiden Ranking Open Edition [@van_eck_2024_10949622], which is based on the document types in OpenAlex.

In this blog post, we examine the recent changes in document type classification in OpenAlex and contrast the findings with the approaches of Scopus and Web of Science. 

## Data and Methods
For our analysis we reused the dataset that was compiled for the preprint and updated the respective document types to match current developments. The initial dataset included approximately 9.5 million publications that occur in OpenAlex as well as in Scopus, WoS, PubMed and Semantic Scholar. In addition, to align with the methods applied in the preprint, we restricted the data to the publication years 2012 to 2022 and only considered items from journals. OpenAlex data used in this report is from July 2024. Scopus and WoS data is from April 2024. The initial dataset was compiled using data from mid 2023. Data is hosted by the [German Competence Network of Bibliometrics](https://bibliometrie.info).

However, after matching data from OpenAlex with Scopus and Web of Science, we found that the numbers retrieved from the databases are very similar. To avoid a bias stemming from the PubMed data we originally worked with, whose document types OpenAlex has adopted with the latest changes, we performed a full comparison of OpenAlex with Scopus and WoS. The restriction to the publication type "Journal" and the years 2012 to 2022 have been retained.

## Findings

The following figures compare the OpenAlex classification system with Scopus and Web of Science. Notably, the proportion of articles and reviews is relatively equal between the data sources. This is a important improvement compared to 2023, where OpenAlex does not distinguish between research articles and reviews. 

```{r echo=FALSE, layout='l-body', fig.cap='Comparison of OpenAlex and Scopus (Placeholder)'}
knitr::include_graphics('./media/oal_scp_type_2024.png', dpi=NA)
```

Nevertheless, the figures, especially Figure 2, demonstrate that the commercial data sources still classify more items as editorial content than OpenAlex. It can be seen that a number of articles in OpenAlex are labelled as editorials or letters in Scopus and Web of Science.

```{r echo=FALSE, layout='l-body', fig.cap='Comparison of OpenAlex and Web of Science (Placeholder)'}
knitr::include_graphics('./media/oal_wos_type_2024.png', dpi=NA)
```

This observation is encouraged when looking at the following table. Here, the document types contained in each database are reclassified into the categories editorial discourse and research discourse. The proportion of editorial content labelled in OpenAlex is still about 3% lower than in Scopus and Web of Science. Mapping tables that we used for reclassifying the document types can be found in the appendix of our preprint.

## Discussion and Conclusion
Our updated results demonstrated a considerable improvement of the classification of document types in OpenAlex when comparing it to Scopus and WoS. Compared to data from 2023, the discrepancy in the classification of items has decreased remarkably. This also indicates a convergence of the classification system in OpenAlex towards those from proprietary databases, with an enhanced coverage of reviews and editorial materials. In addition, the rule-based string matching for recognising paratexts introduced and revised by OpenAlex resulted in more texts being categorised as editorial material than before. This development strengthens OpenAlex's position as a free provider of bibliometric data and makes it more attractive as a competitor to the established bibliometric databases.
