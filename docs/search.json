With this blog, we want to engage with the broader community about how to support data-driven workflows and decision-making around scholarly communication with R.\nWe are based at the Göttingen State and University Library, one of the largest academic libraries in Germany. We are using R-based tools in our everyday work and contribute to R package developments and training activities. In this blog, you’ll find news and case-studies around:\nOpen Access and Open Science Analytics\nR Packages making use of open databases and helping us in our work\nR Tools for interactive visualizations and dashboard developments\nR-related training and outreach activities\nWe want to thank Maëlle Salmon for encouraging us to start a blog about our work. As a technical framework for the blog, we are using Distill for R Markdown, a new web publishing format optimized for scientific and technical writing.\nDr. Anne Hobert, Najko Jahn\n\n\n\n",
